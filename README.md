# Vanity Plates - CS50P Project

This is my solution to the **Vanity Plates** problem from Harvard's CS50P (CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python).

## ðŸ§  Problem Description

The program determines whether a given vanity license plate is valid based on these rules:

- Plates must start with at least two letters.
- Plates must be between 2 and 6 characters long.
- Numbers, if used, must be at the end.
- The first number used cannot be `0`.
- No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.

## ðŸ’» How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python vanity.py
